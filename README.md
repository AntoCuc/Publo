Publo - meaning: small, humble
==============================

*Create great web content using [markdown][markdownspec].*

Publo allows you to generate content freely anywhere you might be.

Write and preview content for your website with no need for an internet connection.

Customise the Look and Feel with an advanced templating system and when you are ready upload it to your hosting.

Getting Started
--------------

Publo's main editing function can be accessed via the central Editor.

The markdown written is automatically saved and previewed in the preview area so
you can keep an eye on how the information flows on the site template.

The exported content is fully operational in offline mode so that after exporting
you can also view changes offline with your favourite browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

Publo's utilities are operated via the function keys:  

F1  - Load the about, credits and help system. Also links to this page.  
F2 (When operating the File browser) - Rename files  
F6  - Upload the site  
F7  - Export the site (Find the resulting markup in the project "target" folder)  
F11 - Enter full screen mode (Escape to exit full screen)  

Via key combination:  

Ctrl+Shift+N - Create a new project  

Via mouse:  

Right-click (When operating the file browser) - Create new file or directory  

History
-------

The first version of Publo was built as part of a challenge. A friend commented on Java and Swing complaining about speed of development, especially when a Swing GUI was present.

We bet a fancy coffee that I would be able to write and release a basic markdown editor on my train home (1.5 hours). Needless to say the challenge was accepted. Publo was born. The first few commits show Publo in its infancy.

Since then Publo was ported to JavaFX 2.0.

Features
--------

* Editing markdown documents - Allows you to create great content
* Preview HTML - To view how your content looks before publishing it
* Apply custom templates - Design your very own web UI
* Export - To generate a site ready for upload to your favourite hosting or local browsing
* Run on Windows, OSX and Linux - Because every platform has something special <3

Templates
---------

Publo supports the creation of custom templates via the [thymeleaf template engine][thymeleaf].

Creating a custom template is easy:

1. Create a blank html file - for example: `my-template.html`
2. Place the attribute `th:utext="${main}"` in the tag wrapping your content
3. Save the newly created template file in `~/.publo/<project directory>/templates`
4. To start using the template create a new page metadata item with the "template" key and template file name value.  

Example template reference:

```
---

template: my-template

---
```

Page-level template definitions allow the most flexible user experience customisation.

The templating engine's full documentation can be found on the [thymeleaf official documentation][thymeleafdocs].

### A note on page metadata when using Publo ###

Markdown is a syntax that focuses primarily on webpages main content.
Hence, the use of the `main` attribute for template rendering in Publo.  
However, webpages may contain useful metadata (titles, descriptions, author tags ...).

Publo uses YAML front matter for the definition of such metadata.

Below an example of the syntax for front matter:

```
---

title: Title of the page
description: Description of the page
<key>: <value>

---
```

Populating the template with custom data  can be achieved with `th:utext="${<key>}"`.
