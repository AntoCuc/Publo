Publo
=====

*A cross-platform, distraction-less, markdown editor.*

Publo was built as part of a challenge a friend (John) made me. He commented on Java and Swing complaining about speed of development, especially when a Swing GUI was present.

We bet a fancy coffee that I would be able to write and release a basic markdown editor on my train home (1.5 hours). Needless to say the challenge was accepted. Publo was born. The first few commits show Publo in its infancy.

Since then Publo was ported to the JavaFX GUI library. The application is very simple in its current form.

The original principle of speed of development entailed that Publo's features are very limited and that is still the case.

Publo users can perform the following operations on markdown files:

* Open
* Save
* Edit
* Preview
* Apply templates
    * Default
    * Pyxill
    * Github
    * Gothic
* Export site
