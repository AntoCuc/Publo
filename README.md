Publo
=====

*A cross-platform, distraction-less, markdown editor.*

Publo was built as part of a challenge with a friend (John) making a comment on Java and Swing. John complained that applications written in Java were slow to write, especially when a Swing GUI was present.

We bet a fancy coffee that I would be able to write and release a basic markdown editor on my train home (1.5 hours). Needless to say the challenge was accepted. Publo was born.

Publo's features are fairly limited at this stage. It allows to perform basic file operations and html preview.
