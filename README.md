Publo
=====

*Publo enables web writers create great [markdown][markdownspec] content.*

The preview and export facility are the primary features of the editor that when combined with
the ability to easily create templates allow you to design a unique user experience. 

History
-------

The first version of Publo was built as part of a challenge. A friend commented on Java and Swing complaining about speed of development, especially when a Swing GUI was present.

We bet a fancy coffee that I would be able to write and release a basic markdown editor on my train home (1.5 hours). Needless to say the challenge was accepted. Publo was born. The first few commits show Publo in its infancy.

Since then Publo was ported to JavaFX 2.0.

Features
--------

* Editing markdown documents - Allows the creation of great content
* Preview HTML - To view how your content looks before publishing it
* Apply custom templates - to design your very own web UI
* Export sites - To generate a site ready for upload
* Run on Windows, OSX and Linux - Because every platform has something special <3

Templates 
---------

Publo supports the creation of custom templates via the [thymeleaf template engine][thymeleaf].

To create a basic template:

1. Create an html file - for example: `my-template.html`
2. Place the attribute `th:utext="${main}"` in the tag containing your content
3. Place the newly created template in the `publo-projects/templates` directory
4. Select it from the drop-down to use it for preview and export

Full documentation can be found on the [thymeleaf official documentation][thymeleafdocs].

### A note on page metadata ###

Markdown is a syntax that focuses primarily on the main content of the page.
Hence, the use of the `main` attribute for template rendering.
However, webpages, for a range of reasons, may contain useful metadata (titles, descriptions, author tags ...).
Publo uses YAML front matter for the definition of such metadata.
Below an example of the syntax for front matter:

```
---

title: Title of the page
description: Description of the page
<key>: <value>

---
```

Populating the template with custom data  can be achieved with `th:utext="${<key>}"`.
